## Created using

`npx create-next-app next-amplify-auth`
`yarn add @aws-amplify/cli -D` could create global install, but I choose to include it here

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
