# next-digital-garden

A digital garden site build with NextJS for static site hosting. Most likely this site will be hosted on Netlify.

## Tools

  - NextJS (using @next/mdx)
  - React
  - @mdx/mdx and @mdx/react
  - theme-ui


### Inspired By

[Ryan Warner][Ryan Warner] created a starter for MDX. We worked on getting MDX and frontmatter publishing as can be seen here. We ended up using `src/utils/renderWithReact` to render our dynamically linked pages.
